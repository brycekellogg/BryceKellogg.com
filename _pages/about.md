I am a Ph.D. Student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington,
where I work in the Computer Science & Engineering Wireless and Mobile Systems Lab.
I received a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a Bachelors in Computer Engineering
in 2013, and a Masters in Electrical Engineering in 2016, also from the University of
Washington. In 2013, I completed a 12 month internship at Xilinx Inc. in San Jose, CA.

My research interests revolve around ultra-low-power embedded systems and the devices and
techniques required to expand their role in the computing world. This includes topics such
as low-power sensing, RF power harvesting, battery-free platforms, and ultra-low-power
wireless communication.

On a more personal note, I am a member of the UW Judo Club holding the rank of ikkyÅ«;
I am an Eagle Scout and avid outdoorsman (the Pacific Northwest has beautiful hiking trails);
and recently I received my Ham Radio General License (KG7NVS).
