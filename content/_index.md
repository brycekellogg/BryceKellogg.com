I am an Electrical Engineer and Computer Scientist with a background in
Embedded Systems and Wireless Communications. Currently I work as Director of
Engineering at Jeeva Wireless where we architect and develop state of the art
ultra-low power communications protocols and platforms.

I have a Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington,
as well as a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and a Bachelors in Computer
Engineering also from the UW.
My research interests revolve around ultra-low-power embedded systems and the devices and
techniques required to expand their role in the computing world. This includes topics such
as low-power sensing, RF power harvesting, battery-free platforms, and ultra-low-power
wireless communication.

In my free time, I practice Judo (holding the rank of ikkyÅ«), enthusiastically
hike the many beautiful trails of the Pacific Northwest, and voraciously consume
Sci-Fi novels. I am an Eagle Scout and Ham Radio operator (KG7NVS).
